PlugBrain is an app that encourages regular breaks from distracting apps by blocking access at scheduled intervals.
To regain access, you’ll need to solve a math challenge that adjusts in difficulty: 
the more frequently you use the apps, 
the harder the challenges become — but the longer you stay away, the easier they get.
